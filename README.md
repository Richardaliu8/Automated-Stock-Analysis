# Automated-Stock-Analysis
Project Overview  
This project aims to enhance the understanding and prediction of stock movements through fundamental and technical analysis using Python. By focusing on fundamental indicators derived from annual financial reports, we apply linear regression models to predict the estimated shares outstanding and assess the significance of various predictors using False Discovery Rate (FDR) control.  

Features  
Data Exploration and Visualization: Extensive exploration and visualization of stock market data, identifying key trends and patterns in fundamental financial metrics.  
Linear Regression Model: Develop ment of a linear regression model to predict stock-related metrics, such as estimated shares outstanding, using financial data.  
Multicollinearity Analysis: Examination of how multicollinearity affects the interpretation of linear regression coefficients, enhancing the model's reliability and interpretability.  
P-Value Histogram: Analysis of the distribution of p-values from regression outputs to assess the skewness and infer statistical significance.  
FDR Control with BH Procedure: Application of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the False Discovery Rate, identifying truly significant predictors amidst multiple comparisons.  
Interaction Terms: Expansion of the regression model to include interaction terms, evaluating their impact on model performance and the significance of predictors.  

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of automating stock market analysis through advanced statistical techniques. By leveraging linear regression and controlling for false discoveries, the project seeks to provide deeper insights into which fundamental factors are truly impactful, thus aiding in more informed decision-making for stock market investments.
